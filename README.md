My notes about Plan 9 and [9front](http://9front.org) (a Plan 9 fork).

## What?

[Plan 9 from Bell Labs](https://p9f.org/about.html) (or "Plan 9", for short) is an awesome research operating system which demonstrates how most of the software we use today is over-complicated and over-engineered for the problems it needs to solve. This peculiarity in modern software often leads to complications during its development.

Plan 9 follows the principles of the [Unix philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy), and--to a certain extent--is similar to most contemporary Unix-like operating systems, like Linux and BSDs. However, on the other hand, Plan 9 cannot be thought of as a Unix-like operating system. It is a direct descendant of [Research Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Unix) and takes Unix's ["everything is a file"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_is_a_file) concept to the extreme. Now files are text streams and the filesystem is not just a representation of data stored on the disk, but an interface for programs and users.

## Why?

I am maintaining this repository with useful resources and links to allow other people to know more about Plan 9, because I think it deserves more popularity.
