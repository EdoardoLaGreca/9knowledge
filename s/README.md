The `s` directory contains scripts.

In each script the comment right after the shebang describes the script's purpose and how it works.

Scripts whose name ends in `.sh` are supposed to be run on Unix-like operating systems. On the other hand, scripts whose name ends in `.rc` are supposed to be run on 9front.
