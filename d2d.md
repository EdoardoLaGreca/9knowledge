# Useful day-to-day stuff

Use `man [section] title` to search for the manual page `title` in `section`, or `lookman key` to search for all manual pages that contain `key`.

Pressing Control-D in Rio generates an EOT character, which is like a newline, but it is not delivered to the running program. An EOT serves as EOF indication. Control-D in Plan 9 has a similar effect to Control-C in Unix.

## File system

- [`file`](https://man.9front.org/1/file) - classify file
- [`bind`](https://man.9front.org/1/bind) - bind a source file to a destination file, so that the destination is an alias for the source
- [`mount`](https://man.9front.org/1/bind) - mount (i.e. "attach") the contents of a directory tree to another directory tree
- [`unmount`](https://man.9front.org/1/bind) - undo bind or mount
- [`9fs`](https://man.9front.org/4/srv) - dial a machine and mount its file system
- [`ns`](https://man.9front.org/1/ns) - represent the name spaces of a process
- [`rcpu`](https://man.9front.org/1/rcpu) - connect to a CPU server and start a shell on it
- [`rimport`](https://man.9front.org/1/rcpu) - connect to a CPU server and mount a directory tree from it
- [`rexport`](https://man.9front.org/1/rcpu) - connect to a CPU server and mount a local directory tree into it

### Name spaces

[What are name spaces?](namespaces.md#informal-definition-of-name-space)

Across the file system there are many mount points. A detailed list is available in `namespace(4)`. 
 
Directories that contain mount points for synthetic file trees are:

- `/n` - mount points imported by remote systems
- `/mnt` - mount points generated by other processes
- `/srv` - connections to file servers, held by the service registry
- `/shr` - mounted file systems available to all name spaces, also called the *global mount point device*

Other synthetic file trees are:

- `/dev` - I/O devices
- `/net` - network devices 
- `/env` - environment variables
- `/proc` - active processes
- `/fd` - open file descriptors

Plan 9 provides a default name space to processes as soon as they spawn. To see details of the default name space, open a new Rc session and use the `ns` command.

To edit the default name space, edit the `/lib/namespace` file.
